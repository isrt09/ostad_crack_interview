### Assignment on String
<h3>Task 1: </h3>
<p>Write a function that does the following task</p>
<p>
You are given a string s and an integer array indices of the same length. The string s will be shuffled such that the character at the ith position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string. Return the shuffled string.</p>

<p>Also, mention the Time and Space Complexity of your solution</p>

<h3>Constraints:</h3>

s.length == indices.length == n

1 <= n <= 100

s consists of only lowercase English letters.

0 <= indices[i] < n

All values of indices are unique.

<h3>Task 2: </h3>
<p>Write a function that does the following task.</p>
<p>Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.</p>
<p>Also, mention the Time and Space Complexity of your solution</p>

<h3>Constraints:</h3>

<p>1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 10^4</p>
<p>haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.</p>
