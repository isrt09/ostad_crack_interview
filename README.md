### Task 1:

Write a function that does the following task.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

The input string is given as a string ‘s’.
You must use Recursion to solve the problem.

Also, mention the Time and Space Complexity of your solution.

Constraints: 
1 <= s.length <= 10^5

  
### Task 2:

Write a function that does the following task.

Write a recursive function to multiply given two positive integers ‘a’ and ‘b’ without using the * operator (multiplication operator). You can only use + operator (addition operator) and - operator (subtraction operator).

Also, mention the Time and Space Complexity of your solution

Constraints:
1 <= a, b <= 10^5
